# Implementation of ML-Powered Medical Diagnosis System  

## Overview  
This project implements a **Machine Learning-Powered Medical Diagnosis System** using Django. The system predicts medical conditions based on user input and trained ML models.

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have all required dependencies installed. The necessary modules are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions  

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create a Django Project**  
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject medical_diagnosis
   cd medical_diagnosis
   ```

3. **Save Project Files**  
   Move all necessary files (ML models, views, templates, static files, etc.) into the Django project folder.

4. **Apply Migrations**  
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Server**  
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage  
Once the server is running, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to access the medical diagnosis system.
